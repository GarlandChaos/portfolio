        <p class="itemProfile">Hi! I'm a passionate gamer that decided to study all I can about game development and design. 
           I currently do two graduations: Visual Design at UFRGS and Digital Games at Unisinos. 
           I started the two courses in 2013 and since then I've done three scientific research jobs at UFRGS, envolving game interfaces, 3D modelling and video edition. 
           Everyday I feel i'm evolving and hope to improve myself by creating great new technologies and graphic design projects.
